## ForestFey's VegetableGarden-Addon: Canned Delights

Versions 0.16-0.17 require Vegetable Garden to be loaded before this, known conflicts with VG will likely conflict with this, too.  
ATTENTION: With 0.18 the Vegetable Garden mod was split into several sub-mods, some of which are required for Canned Delights to run properly! You will need the VGP base mod, Gourmet Garden and (tomatoes galore!) More Veggies! loaded before canned delights.  
Starting with 0.19 my mod also requires the new, separate VGP Garden Canning mod.
