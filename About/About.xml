	Adds a couple of new meal-recipes to the canning table from vegetable garden.

New recipes (defnames not necessarily the same):

- HANZ Baked Beans: See you, space cowboy. Contains beans, tomatoes and sugar.

- Fiete's Labskaus: Looks a bit funny and contains... stuff, quite a lot of it. Very nutritious. NOT VEGAN!

- Mayblob's Ricepudding: Alltime classy. Contains rice, sugar, fruit and milk or suitable substitute. Enjoyable to eat.

-->All recipes have the skill requirement (6) of and satisfy like a Fine Meal, but have variable nutrition-values! There's also some other side-effects, similar to other VG-foods... </description>
